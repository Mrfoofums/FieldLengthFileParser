# FieldLengthFileParser
A utility for parsing files based of fixed field lengths.

I'm not sure if this is even worth the effort it took, but it was good practice.

In particular, I think this would be worthwhile if you want to parse multiple fixed field length files, consecutively, with one job
and have some structure. I think more things will become evident as I sit on it.
